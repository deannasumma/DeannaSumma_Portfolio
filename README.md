# Deanna's Portfolio

Deanna Summa's ProductLab Portfolio Demo Repository

This repository holds Deanna's portfolio showcasing her product experience and technical skills she learned during ProductLab. It also holds details on the ProductLab projects and links to her other repos.

## What I Learned:
How to manipulate html code and check in realtime the result using the live link. I learned how to create multipe wrappers and manipulate each to have a different effect on the portfolio sections. This helped me learn best practices with ensuring sections and divs are closed and reopened on the correct lines of code.

### Organized Structure:
- **Assets folder**: Contains CSS and JavaScript files.
- **Images folder**: Stores portfolio images Deanna used.
- **index.html**: Code for Deanna's portfolio.
